# Personal Portfolio ~ Modern

---

So, my old [portfolio](https://github.com/Calvinjmin/Portfolio) was a bit of a disaster and, frankly, outdated.
I have grown a lot as a developer over the years and saw an opportunity to revamp my personal website.
This "modernized" portfolio transforms my basic 3-file static HTML project into a dynamic React application.

Welcome to my new and improved personal portfolio!
