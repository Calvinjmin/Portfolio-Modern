# Personal Portfolio ~ Modern

---

So, my old [portfolio](https://github.com/Calvinjmin/Portfolio) was a bit of a disaster and, frankly, outdated. But it held a special place in my heart—so much so that I created a whole new repo tagged as "modern" just to justify keeping the old one alive. This "modern" project transforms my basic 3-file static HTML project into a "cutting-edge" React application. Welcome to my new and improve personal portfolio!
