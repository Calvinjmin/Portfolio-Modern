To preface, Boston has a lackluster food scene.
It frequently falls short of New York City due to its limited variety of cuisines,
deficiency of creativity in the culinary space, and perhaps, most disappointingly,
the presence of affordable and comforting Korean dining options - not that I am biased.

When my friends visit, I often feel stressed about where to take them to eat.
I wonder: What food will satisfy their tastes? What cuisine will they enjoy at a reasonable price?
Should we splurge a little? After all, as the saying goes, "Good food is the foundation of genuine happiness." — ChatGPT.

Admittedly, many restaurants in Boston tend to be on the expensive side.
They often lack the quality of food to justify the prices on their menu,
and this creates a frustrating situation for food lovers like myself, who want great meals without
emptying their wallets. With this in mind, I have compiled a list of restaurants I have enjoyed with at least one other person, and I feel semi-confident in recommending them.

* **Krasi (Back Bay)** - A casual Greek restaurant that serves freshly made tzatziki at the table and offers a generous selection of meat-based dishes.
* **Matsunori Hand Roll (Fenway-Kenmore)** - I'm usually not a fan of sushi, but their miso-cod hand roll is to die for.
* **Yume Ga Arukara (Porter Square)** - This hole-in-the-wall udon restaurant does its job well by providing delicious udon.
* **Monica's Mercato (North End)** - A sandwich shop that will live rent-free for at least a week.
* **Bom Dough (Inman Square)** - A Brazilian-inspired coffee shop that serves tasty matcha lattes and fresh pão de queijo.
* **Berryline (Harvard Square)** - It pains me to share this place because I want to keep it a secret, but the public needs to know.
Berryline is the best-frozen yogurt I have ever had - make an effort to try it out.

All this is to say that everyone has their preferences and needs, but you can't go wrong with the places listed above—especially Berryline.
While I love keeping my favorite food spots a secret, I figure that if I share them with my friends, I might as well share them with everyone!

Notice that there is an absence of Korean restaurants on this list ... I would recommend taking a **$50 Amtrak** to NYC for that.
